## What is the Hero Editor Item Pack?
 
The Hero Editor Item Pack is a collection of items and single player characters that can be used with the Hero Editor program for Diablo 2. The Hero Editor is a program that allows you to modify your Diablo 2 character and item files. You can change your character's stats, skills, attributes, level, quests, waypoints, inventory, stash, mercenary, and more. You can also import and export items from your character's inventory or stash using the Hero Editor.
 
The Hero Editor Item Pack was created by Ginger Gaming Mentor (GGM), who compiled and updated a previous item pack by Kingpint'z. GGM's item pack offers significant advantages over previous packs, such as:
 
- A complete collection of unique items, adding many missing items to the files.
- A complete collection of runewords with more varied bases, adding many missing runewords as well as new runewords that were patched in on version 2.4.
- Ethereal versions of all unique items for easier importing with correct defense values.
- Updated class torches with correct values.
- White/socketed bases of every item in the game for easier importing and creation of new runewords.
- "What if" section of ethereal sets for fun and experimentation.
- Fixed unique items with incorrect values such as Tyrael's Might, Stormlash, and more.

You can use the Hero Editor Item Pack for both Diablo 2 and Diablo 2 Resurrected. However, you need to use different versions of the Hero Editor program depending on which game you are playing. For Diablo 2, you need to use Hero Editor V1.04. For Diablo 2 Resurrected, you need to use Hero Editor V1.05 Beta.
